# TODO List
- [ ] Implement the `Adam` optimizer
- [ ] ~~Implement the `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` for the data loader~~
    - by the desgin mindset, the nn framework should not be responsible for the data preprocessing

# TODO List
- [ ] Add test cases for the data loader
- [ ] Add test cases for the trainer
    - consider to embed the trainer into the model as `model.fit()`
- [ ] Implement the `logger` and support output format CSV, JSON, and tensorboard
- [ ] Implement the `EarlyStopping` callback
- [ ] Implement the `ModelCheckpoint` callback
- [ ] Implement the `gradient clipping` in the trainer
- [ ] Implement the utility functions to plot the training and validation loss
- [ ] Implement the `data augmentation` for the data loader
- [ ] Implement the `data normalization` for the data loader
- [ ] Add notebook to explain how backpropagation, auto grad and the computation graph works
- [ ] Add note to explain how importain the `command pattern` and `responsibility chain pattern` are in the framework design
